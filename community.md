# Community Energy & Local Action

The Killala Sustainable Energy Community (SEC) brings together residents, schools, and local businesses to explore how our town can transition toward a cleaner, more affordable energy future.  
We’re part of the national SEC Network supported by the **Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)**, and our focus is simple — **to make local energy work for local people.**

---

## ⚡ Current Focus Areas

- **Killala Energy Master Plan (EMP):** Developing a roadmap to reduce local emissions and improve building efficiency across homes, community buildings, and the Killala Business Park.
