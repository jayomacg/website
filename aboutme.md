### Energy Policy Researcher, Building Energy Counsultant and Sustainable Energy Community founder ###

I have always had a passion for energy, and I worked on Building Management Systems in Melbourne, Australia for 8 years. I returned to Ireland to further my studies, while working on techno-economic models, I found a strong desire to better understand economics, which plays a huge role in how energy is supplied and consumed. The social equality aspect of the required energy transition is appealing to me, as I have harvested peat around Ireland's largest windfarm. 

I graduated with a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in 2009. The final year of the degree focused on Energy Management. Jason’s final year thesis was entitled “Energy Management in Galway’s Vocational Education Committees”. In 2010 Jason went to Australia and worked on Building Energy Management Systems for 8 years. Jason returned to Ireland in 2018 and completed his master in Sustainable Energy from University College Cork in September 2019.
Jason Mc Guire is working on developing sustainable energy pathways for Ireland using the newly developed TIMES Ireland Model (TIM), with a particular focus on residential energy. Heating uses the majority of energy in the residential sector and it is mainly fossil fuel based, especially among the older housing stock. Jason’s first journal paper is entitled Developing decarbonisation pathways in changing TIMES for Irish homes, current research is working on a paper entitled Is the fabric first approach a costly delay in achieving residentialclimate targets? while later this year plans are in place to work alongside the Danish Energy Agency to develop District Heating within TIM.

The other part of Jason’s research is developing eithical carbon budgets for Ireland. Ireland will be introducing their first 5-year carbon budget starting 2021 – 2025, then 2026 to 2030 and so on. The carbon budgets are based upon robust scientific metrics to limit global warming. The carbon budget depends on the global warming temperature limit and different ethical sharing methodologies while also complying to EU and national targets. In regards this Jason released a discussion paper [The role of carbon budgets in translating the Paris Agreement into national climate policy](https://www.marei.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Discussion-Paper_The-role-of-carbon-budgets-in-translating-the-Paris-Agreement-into-national-climate-policy.pdf), [Here’s what should be on Eamon Ryan’s ministerial to-do list](https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2020/0707/1151798-eamon-ryan-minister-climate-change-heating-transport/) and an article on [How can understanding human nature help to better inform climate policy decisions?](https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2021/0914/1246636-human-nature-social-discount-rate-climate-change-policies/)
